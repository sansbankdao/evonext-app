# WASM SDK Integration Status

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. **WASM SDK Build** - Successfully built and copied to `/lib/dash-wasm/`
2. **Service Layer Architecture** - Created modular service architecture
3. **Environment Configuration** - Using existing `.env` configuration

### Phase 2: Core Services Implementation
4. **Base Services**
   - `wasm-sdk-service.ts` - SDK initialization and lifecycle management
   - `document-service.ts` - Base class for all document operations
   - `state-transition-service.ts` - Handles document creation/updates/deletes

5. **Identity & Authentication**
   - `identity-service.ts` - Identity fetching and balance checking
   - `auth-context.tsx` - Updated to use WASM SDK services
   
6. **Profile Management**
   - `profile-service.ts` - Profile CRUD operations
   - `dpns-service.ts` - DPNS resolution (placeholder - not yet in WASM SDK)

7. **Content Services**
   - `post-service.ts` - Post creation and querying
   - `like-service.ts` - Like/unlike functionality
   - `repost-service.ts` - Repost functionality
   - `follow-service.ts` - Follow/unfollow users
   - `bookmark-service.ts` - Bookmark posts

## Current Status üöÄ

### WASM SDK Capabilities
1. **State Transitions WORKING! ‚úÖ**
   - `documentCreate`, `documentReplace`, `documentDelete` methods are fully functional
   - Successfully integrated into state transition service
   - Requires private key to be stored in sessionStorage

2. **DPNS Functions WORKING! ‚úÖ**
   - Username resolution works through document queries
   - Can resolve identity ‚Üí username and username ‚Üí identity
   - Username search by prefix is functional
   - Username availability check works
   - DPNS registration still requires specialized state transitions

3. **Query Support**
   - Basic queries work (get_documents, get_document)
   - Complex queries with where/orderBy are fully supported
   - No aggregation or count functions yet

### Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ Read operations (fetching documents, identities)
- ‚úÖ Write operations (creating posts, likes, follows) - NOW WORKING!
- ‚úÖ DPNS resolution (username lookup, search) - NOW WORKING!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è DPNS registration (requires special state transitions)
- ‚úÖ Full query capabilities with where/orderBy

## Next Steps üìã

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Update UI Components**
   - Replace mock data calls with service layer
   - Add proper loading states
   - Implement error boundaries

2. **Error Handling**
   - Create user-friendly error messages
   - Add retry mechanisms
   - Implement offline detection

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement proper caching strategies
   - Add request debouncing
   - Optimize re-renders

### Blocked Tasks (Waiting for WASM SDK Updates)
1. **DPNS Registration**
   - Requires specialized preorder/register state transitions
   - More complex than regular document creation

3. **Advanced Queries**
   - Aggregation support
   - Count queries
   - Complex joins

## Testing Instructions

1. **Basic Testing**: Navigate to `/test-wasm` to see SDK read capabilities
2. **Creation Testing**: Navigate to `/test-create` to test document creation
3. The SDK can now:
   - Initialize successfully
   - Fetch identities
   - Query documents with complex where/orderBy clauses
   - CREATE new documents (posts, profiles, likes, etc.)
   - UPDATE existing documents
   - DELETE documents
4. The SDK can also:
   - Resolve DPNS names (identity ‚Üî username)
   - Search usernames by prefix
   - Check username availability
5. The SDK cannot yet:
   - Register new DPNS names (requires special state transitions)

## Architecture Benefits

Despite current limitations, the architecture is ready for full functionality:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Type-safe service layer
- Easy to update when SDK features are available
- Consistent error handling
- Built-in caching and optimization

## Recommendations

1. **For Development**: Use mock data for write operations while SDK is being updated
2. **For Testing**: Focus on read operations and UI integration
3. **For Production**: Wait for complete WASM SDK implementation of state transitions
